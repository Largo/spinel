# The usability check runs on the EXPANDED path, the one Dir.tmpdir hands
# back, not on $TMPDIR as the shell left it. The expansion is lexical, so a
# `..` after a symlink names a different directory than the raw string: here
# "<base>/ro/ln/.." resolves through the link to a writable directory while
# the expanded "<base>/ro" is not writable at all. Checking the raw path
# answered "<base>/ro", and Dir.mktmpdir then raised where CRuby falls back
# to /tmp (CRuby also warns "TMPDIR is not writable"; this package is silent
# about it, as it is about every other rejected candidate).
