# spinel: posix -- permission bits (world-writable, sticky)
# Dir.mktmpdir's block form refuses to clean up through a parent that is
# world-writable and not sticky, and only checks a parent it chose itself.
#
# Before this change the check could never fire: it asked for the sticky
# bit to be set and clear at once, so a directory under a world-writable,
# non-sticky Dir.tmpdir was removed without complaint. Now the check reads
# the two bits the way CRuby does, and as in CRuby it is skipped when the
# caller named the parent: that parent is the caller's to vouch for. When
# the check fires the ArgumentError is the answer and the directory is
# left where it is.
#
# Every mode change is on a directory this test made, and the ensure at the
# end puts it back to 0700 and removes it with whatever an arm left inside,
# so a failing arm does not leave a world-writable directory behind.
