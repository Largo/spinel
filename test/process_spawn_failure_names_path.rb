# spinel: posix -- spawns /etc/passwd for EACCES
# A spawn that fails names what failed, and leaves its exit status in $?.
#
# The child reports its errno through the pipe, and now also whether it was
# the chdir or the exec that failed. The parent raises the matching Errno
# with CRuby's message, the strerror text followed by the program or the
# directory, where before it read "cannot execute - No such file or
# directory" and named nothing. The child it reaps before raising was the
# last one waited for, so $? reads its exit 127 afterwards, as it does under
# CRuby; before this change $? was left as it was.
